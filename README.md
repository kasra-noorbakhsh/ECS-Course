# üóùÔ∏è Essential Computer Skills Course Assignments

This repository contains solutions to four Computer Assignments (CA-1 through CA-4) from the Essential Computer Skills course. Each assignment directory includes subfolders for different parts, implementing concepts such as remote server management, text editing with Vim, version control with Git, signal handling, kernel programming, Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, port scanning, regular expressions, debugging, and performance profiling.

## üìå Project Overview

- **CA-1**:
  - Question 1: Running MOSH without root access on the server.
  - Question 2: SSH-based remote server automation and monitoring with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), including server setup, Python environment, SSH client with role-based permissions, server automation for backups and updates, and secure file transfer with SFTP.
  - Question 3: System health monitoring from boot time and process management, including resource monitoring, alerting, and suspending high-consumption processes.
  - Question 4: System booting and using GRUB, including bootloader mechanisms, BIOS vs. UEFI, kernel loading, GRUB configuration, and boot performance analysis.

- **CA-2**:
  - Question 1: Working with the Vim editor, including navigation, editing, searching, saving, comparing files, configuring .vimrc, adding plugins like NERDTree, and using macros.
  - Question 2: Version control with Git and Mercurial, including repository setup, branching, committing, merging, rebasing, and descriptive questions on tools like blame and bisect.
  - Question 3: Managing signals in Linux for process control and terminal reclamation, modifying code to handle signals like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z.
  - Question 4: Kernel programming, writing a simple kernel module with initialization and exit functions, compiling with Makefile, inserting/removing modules, and descriptive questions on kernel concepts.
  - Question 5: Implementing a character device driver for a virtual LIFO device with read-only and write-only modes, including user-space test scripts.

- **CA-3**:
  - Question 1: Docker, building Dockerfiles for Go web app and 2048 game, modifying docker-compose for voting-app with Nginx reverse proxy, subdomains, authentication, and environment variables.
  - Question 2: Kubernetes, setting up a single-node cluster with tools like kind, creating multi-node configurations, exploring ReplicationController vs. ReplicaSet, deployments, rollout strategies, autoscaling with HPA/VPA, and descriptive questions on PV/PVC, CNI, affinity, and KEDA.
  - Question 3: Port scanning detection, analyzing PCAP files with Python (scapy or dpkt) to identify SYN scan attacks by comparing SYN and SYN+ACK packets.

- **CA-4**:
  - Question 1: Regular expressions for input validation in forms (email, phone, password, product code, stop word, repeated phrases, date, quotations, parentheses), web scraping from IMDb top chart, and descriptive questions on regex applications and limitations.
  - Question 2: Descriptive question on debugging code that works in development but fails in production or other environments.
  - Question 3: Profiling a data preprocessing pipeline with tools like cProfile, line_profiler, memory_profiler; optimizing code; comparing methods for conditional operations on DataFrame columns (apply, map, numpy where); and descriptive questions on production profiling and multithreaded profiling.
